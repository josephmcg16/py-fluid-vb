    Public Function CStarHydrogen(UpstreamTemperatureABS As Double, UpstreamPressureABS As Double) As Double

        '   Function to calculate C*, critical flow factor, for gaseous hydrogen.

        '   This implementation uses coefficients with 8 significant digits.

        '   The correlation is valid from 0.95 to 20 bar(a) between 245 and 330 K.

        '   Inputs
        '       UpstreamTemperatureABS   -   absolute temperature, in K
        '       UpstreamPressureABS   -   absolute pressure, in Pa

        '   Output
        '       CStar   -   critical flow factor

        '   Correlation developed by Gary Corpron, CEESI, based on data from Robert Johnston, NASA.
